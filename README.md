# CNN_Skin_Cancer_detection
This project builds a multiclass image classification model using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow to detect melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. Early detection can support dermatologists by reducing manual diagnostic effort.

The model classifies skin lesion images into nine classes using a complete deep learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance improvement techniques.

**Key Highlights :**

Image preprocessing and dataset creation

Custom CNN model with image normalization

Model training and evaluation to identify overfitting/underfitting

Use of data augmentation to improve generalization

Handling class imbalance using the Augmentor library

Final model trained on balanced data for improved performance

This project demonstrates practical skills in deep learning, image classification, and model optimization for real-world healthcare applications.
